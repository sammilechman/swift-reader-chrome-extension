Swift Reader Chrome Extension
==============================

This Chrome extension (found [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/swift-chrome-extension/pbabmjhfpjdmjapmggkhjleffjkkgbao)) is a companion application to [Swift Reader](http://www.swift-reader.com/). The source code for the original project can be found [here](https://github.com/sammilechman/swift-reader).

This application makes it easy to Swift from anywhere on the internet using your Chrome browser. After you install the extension, highlight text anywhere, right click, and select "Swift it!". Your text selection will pop up in a new tab inside the Swift application.

Developed using standard Chrome store format using a JSON file alongside JavaScript.
